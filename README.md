# flash-archive

A list of Legendary Flash Games saved in a `.sfw` format as an archive.

### TL;DR
- [Ruffle Emulator](https://ruffle.rs)
- [Flash Player Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flash-playlist/nddmmcpmdbkooddfjcohmlcfclhllgeh)
- [Guide to exporting Flash Games locally](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/Extracting_Flash_Games)

### How do I play these games?

You can use an emulator like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) to play those games.

I also hosted [a site](https://antomuto4.github.io/flash-archive) for all the games that are on here so you can play them easily in your browser without installing the games. However you do need an extension called [Flash Player](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flash-playlist/nddmmcpmdbkooddfjcohmlcfclhllgeh/) to get these working.

### How can I export flash games that are still online to this day?

You can follow this BlueMixima Guide which even mentions how to export them as a Windows Executable file. ([click here](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/Extracting_Flash_Games))
