# flash-archive

A list of Legendary Flash Games saved in a `.sfw` format as an archive.

### How do I play these games?

You can use an emulator like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) to play those games.

I also hosted [a site](https://antomuto4.github.io/flash-archive) for all the games that are on here so you can play them easily in your browser without installing the games. However you do need an extention called [Flash Player](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flash-playlist/nddmmcpmdbkooddfjcohmlcfclhllgeh/) to get these working.

### Releases

~~In the releases tab, there will be a compressed file that will have a list of all of these files inside. Meaning you can instantly install all of these games and back them up locally if you wish to do so without cloning the repository.~~

### How can I export flash games that are still online to this day?

You can follow this BlueMixima Guide which even mentions how to export them as a Windows Executable file. ([click here](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/Extracting_Flash_Games))
